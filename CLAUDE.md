# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Rust rewrite of [beanstalkd](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd), a simple and fast work queue. The original C source is in `tmp/` for reference. We use tokio for async I/O.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
cargo build                        # Build
cargo test                         # Run all tests
cargo test test_name               # Run a single test
cargo clippy                       # Lint
cargo fmt -- --check               # Check formatting
cargo run -- -l 0.0.0.0 -p 11300  # Run server
```

## Architecture

The codebase mirrors the original C beanstalkd structure:

- **`src/main.rs`** - CLI entry point using clap subcommands (`server`, `put`, `stats`, `tubes`, `work`). Parses args and dispatches.
- **`src/lib.rs`** - Library root, exports all modules.
- **`src/server.rs`** - Tokio TCP server, accepts connections and dispatches to protocol handler.
- **`src/protocol.rs`** - Beanstalkd text protocol parser and command dispatch. The protocol is line-based (`\r\n` terminated). See `tmp/prot.c` for the full C implementation. Includes tuber extensions: `idp:`, `grp:`, `aft:`, `con:` tags on `put`, `reserve-mode`, `flush-tube`, and `flush-buried`.
- **`src/job.rs`** - Job struct and job storage (hash table). Jobs have states: Ready, Reserved, Buried, Delayed. Jobs are ordered by priority then ID. Includes fields for idempotency key, group, after-group, and concurrency key.
- **`src/tube.rs`** - Named queues ("tubes"). Each tube has a ready heap, delay heap, buried list, and waiting connections list. Default tube is "default".
- **`src/conn.rs`** - Per-connection state: current tube (`use`), watched tubes (`watch`), reserved jobs list, reserve mode (FIFO or weighted), and read/write buffers.
- **`src/heap.rs`** - Binary min-heap used for ready queue (priority ordering), delay queue (deadline ordering), and connection timeouts.
- **`src/wal.rs`** - Write-ahead log for persistence (optional, enabled with `-b`).
- **`src/client.rs`** - TCP client for connecting to a tuber server. Used by CLI subcommands.
- **`src/cmd_put.rs`** - CLI `put` command: submits jobs to a tube, supports stdin piping.
- **`src/cmd_stats.rs`** - CLI `stats` command: displays global or per-tube statistics.
- **`src/cmd_tubes.rs`** - CLI `tubes` command: lists all tubes with job count summaries.
- **`src/cmd_work.rs`** - CLI `work` command: reserves and executes jobs as shell commands with parallel workers.
- **`src/body_store.rs`** - External body store ("TOAST"). Append-only segment files (`body.NNNNNN`) under `<binlog_dir>/toast/` hold raw job payloads addressed by `BodyId`. Used when persistence is enabled so the WAL only references bodies by id rather than carrying their bytes. Background tokio task compacts sealed segments whose live ratio drops below `COMPACTION_LIVE_RATIO_THRESHOLD` (0.5).
- **`src/metrics.rs`** - Prometheus metrics HTTP server (optional, enabled with `--metrics-port`). Exposes WAL, TOAST, jobs, and per-tube gauges/counters.
- **`src/telemetry.rs`** - Installs the tracing subscriber (level from `-V`) and a global panic hook that reports panics via `tracing::error!` before chaining to the default hook. Without it, a panic in a per-connection tokio task unwinds that task alone and leaves only an unstructured stderr line.

## Persistence model (when `-b` is set)

Two on-disk stores side by side:

- **WAL** (`binlog.NNNNNN` files): metadata records — `FullJob` carrying a `BodyId` reference and `StateChange` for delete/release/bury/kick/timeout. v7 is current; v3 and v4 inline-body records are still readable and migrated into TOAST on first replay.
- **TOAST** (`toast/body.NNNNNN`): append-only body segments. Per-body record header is `body_id u64 + len u32 + crc32 u32 + reserved u32` followed by the bytes. File header is `"TBOD" + version + reserved`.

**Sync ordering:** every WAL fsync is preceded by a TOAST fsync (`Wal::pre_sync_body_store`). A crash mid-sync leaves orphan bodies, never dangling references — orphans are detected on replay and reclaimed via `BodyStore::delete_many`.

**Disk budget:** `--max-storage-bytes` caps WAL + TOAST combined. Puts return `OUT_OF_STORAGE` once the budget minus a one-WAL-segment reserve (≤10 MiB) would be exceeded; state changes (delete/release/bury/kick/touch) always succeed.

**Sync interval:** `--sync-interval` (env `TUBER_SYNC_INTERVAL`, default 100 ms) drives both stores. `--wal-sync-interval` is accepted as a hidden alias for backwards compatibility.

## Error reporting

No external error-reporting SDK, deliberately. Sentry was evaluated and rejected:
its HTTP transport pulls ~90-120 crates (47 → 133/163 built), which is out of
proportion for this tree — the same reasoning that has `metrics.rs` hand-rolling
an HTTP server instead of depending on hyper. Errors and panics go out as
structured `tracing` events on stderr; alerting belongs in the log pipeline.

## Key Constants from Original C (dat.h)

- `MAX_TUBE_NAME_LEN`: 201 (tube name max is 200 chars)
- `URGENT_THRESHOLD`: 1024 (jobs with pri < 1024 are "urgent")
- `JOB_DATA_SIZE_LIMIT_DEFAULT`: 65535 bytes
- `JOB_DATA_SIZE_LIMIT_MAX`: 1GB (1073741824)
- `MAX_TUBE_WEIGHT`: 9999 (for weighted reserve mode)
- Default port: 11300
- WAL version: 7 (reads v3–v7; writes v7)
- TOAST version: 1
- TOAST default segment size: 64 MiB
- TOAST compaction threshold: live ratio < 0.5

## Beanstalkd Protocol Commands

Standard beanstalkd commands: `put`, `reserve`, `reserve-with-timeout`, `reserve-job`, `delete`, `release`, `bury`, `kick`, `kick-job`, `touch`, `peek`, `peek-ready`, `peek-delayed`, `peek-buried`, `use`, `watch`, `ignore`, `stats`, `stats-job`, `stats-tube`, `list-tubes`, `list-tube-used`, `list-tubes-watched`, `pause-tube`, `quit`.

Tuber extensions beyond standard beanstalkd:
- `reserve-mode <default|weighted>` - switch between priority-first and weighted-random reserve strategies.
- `peek-reserved` - peek at the oldest reserved job in the current `use` tube. Returns `FOUND <id> <bytes>` or `NOT_FOUND`.
- `flush-tube <tube>` - delete all jobs from a tube. Returns `FLUSHED <count>`.
- `flush-buried <tube>` - delete all buried jobs from a tube, leaving ready/delayed/reserved jobs untouched. Returns `FLUSHED <count>`.
- `reserve-batch <count> [timeout]` - reserve up to `<count>` ready jobs at once (1..=1000). Returns `RESERVED_BATCH <n>` followed by `<n>` `RESERVED <id> <bytes>` blocks. Without `timeout` (or with `timeout 0`) it is non-blocking and may return `RESERVED_BATCH 0`. With a positive `timeout` (seconds) it long-polls: it blocks while 0 jobs are available, then drains whatever is ready (up to `<count>`) the moment the first job arrives, or replies `RESERVED_BATCH 0` on timeout. Use the timeout form to avoid clients hot-looping on empty polls. While blocked, a positive-timeout `reserve-batch` may also return `DEADLINE_SOON` (same as `reserve-with-timeout`) if one of the connection's already-reserved jobs is within the TTR safety margin — an out-of-band interrupt to service that job, not an answer to the reserve.
- `put` extension tags (appended after `<bytes>`): `idp:<key>` (idempotency), `grp:<name>` (job group), `aft:<name>` (after-group dependency), `con:<key>` (concurrency key).
- `watch <tube> [weight]` - optional weight parameter for weighted reserve mode.

Responses are text, e.g. `INSERTED <id>\r\n`, `RESERVED <id> <bytes>\r\n`, `DELETED\r\n`, `NOT_FOUND\r\n`, `BAD_FORMAT\r\n`. Two budget-exhausted responses: `OUT_OF_MEMORY\r\n` (in-RAM cap from `--max-jobs-size`) and `OUT_OF_STORAGE\r\n` (combined disk cap from `--max-storage-bytes`).

## Testing Strategy

Port tests from `tmp/test*.c`:
- **`testjobs.c`** - Unit tests for job creation, priority comparison, hash table operations
- **`testheap.c`** - Unit tests for binary heap insert/remove/ordering
- **`testms.c`** - Unit tests for the resizable multiset (Ms)
- **`testserv.c`** - Integration tests that fork a server process, connect via TCP, and send protocol commands. These should become tokio-based integration tests.

## Connection Types (bitmask)

- `CONN_TYPE_PRODUCER` (1) - set on first `put`
- `CONN_TYPE_WORKER` (2) - set on first `reserve`
- `CONN_TYPE_WAITING` (4) - set when connection is waiting for a job

## Job States

`Ready` -> `Reserved` -> `Deleted`
              \-> `Buried` -> `Kicked` -> `Ready`
              \-> `Delayed` -> `Ready` (after deadline)
`Reserved` -> `Released` -> `Ready`

## Skill

The `skill/SKILL.md` file is mirrored from `tuber-tui` (tuberq/tuber-rs). When updating it, keep both copies in sync.
