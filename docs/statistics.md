# Statistics Reference

Tuber provides detailed statistics at the server, tube, job, and group level
via protocol commands, plus Prometheus metrics for monitoring.

## Global Stats (`stats`)

Returns server-wide statistics in YAML format.

### Job counts

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `current-jobs-urgent` | Jobs with priority < 1024 |

| `binlog-max-size` | Maximum WAL file size |

## Tube Stats (`stats-tube <tube>`)

Returns per-tube statistics in YAML format.

### Job counts and connections

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Tube name |
| `current-jobs-urgent` | Urgent jobs in this tube |
| `current-jobs-ready` | Ready jobs |
| `current-jobs-reserved` | Reserved jobs |
| `current-jobs-delayed` | Delayed jobs |
| `current-jobs-buried` | Buried jobs |
| `total-jobs` | Cumulative jobs created in this tube |
| `current-using` | Connections using this tube for `put` |
| `current-watching` | Connections watching this tube |
| `current-waiting` | Connections waiting for jobs on this tube |
| `cmd-delete` | Cumulative deletes on this tube |
| `cmd-pause-tube` | Cumulative pause commands on this tube |
| `pause` | Current pause duration in seconds |
| `pause-time-left` | Seconds remaining in current pause |

### Throughput and failure rates

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `total-reserves` | Cumulative reserve operations |
| `total-timeouts` | Cumulative TTR timeouts |
| `total-buries` | Cumulative bury operations |
| `bury-rate` | Fraction of reserves that ended in a bury (`total-buries / total-reserves`, 0 if no reserves) |

### Processing time

These fields track how long workers take to complete jobs on this tube,
measured from `reserve` to `delete`.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `processing-time-ewma` | Exponentially weighted moving average of processing time (seconds, alpha=0.1) |
| `processing-time-min` | Minimum observed processing time (seconds) |
| `processing-time-max` | Maximum observed processing time (seconds) |
| `processing-time-samples` | Number of completed jobs included in timing stats |

### Dual EWMA (fast/slow)

Job processing times often have a bimodal distribution — for example, idempotent
jobs that exit immediately vs jobs that do real work. A single EWMA blends these
into a misleading middle value. Tuber splits samples at a 100ms threshold:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `processing-time-fast-threshold` | Threshold separating fast from slow jobs (seconds, currently 0.1) |
| `processing-time-ewma-fast` | EWMA for jobs completing below the threshold (alpha=0.1) |
| `processing-time-samples-fast` | Number of fast samples |
| `processing-time-ewma-slow` | EWMA for jobs completing in >= 100ms (alpha=0.1) |
| `processing-time-samples-slow` | Number of slow samples |

### Percentiles (slow jobs)

Percentiles are computed from the last 1000 slow-job samples (>= 100ms).
Fast jobs are excluded because their EWMA already captures their uniform
behavior — percentiles are most useful for understanding the slow-job tail.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `processing-time-p50` | Median processing time of recent slow jobs (seconds) |
| `processing-time-p95` | 95th percentile processing time (seconds) |
| `processing-time-p99` | 99th percentile processing time (seconds) |

All percentile fields return 0 when no slow samples have been recorded.

### Queue time (time-in-queue)

Queue time measures how long a job waited from `put` to `reserve` — the time
spent in the queue before a worker picked it up. Growing queue time indicates
you need more workers.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `queue-time-ewma` | EWMA of queue time (seconds, alpha=0.1) |
| `queue-time-min` | Minimum observed queue time (seconds) |
| `queue-time-max` | Maximum observed queue time (seconds) |
| `queue-time-samples` | Number of reserves included in queue-time stats |

## Job Stats (`stats-job <id>`)

Returns per-job statistics in YAML format.

|---|---|
| `id` | Job ID |
| `tube` | Tube name |
| `state` | Current state: `ready`, `reserved`, `delayed`, or `buried` |
| `pri` | Priority |
| `age` | Seconds since job was created |
| `delay` | Original delay in seconds |
| `ttr` | Time-to-run in seconds |
| `time-left` | Seconds until deadline (reserved: TTR expiry, delayed: becomes ready) |
| `time-reserved` | Seconds this job has been reserved (0 if not reserved) |
| `reserves` | Times this job has been reserved |
| `timeouts` | Times this job has timed out (TTR expired) |
| `releases` | Times this job has been released |

| `idempotency-ttl` | Cooldown TTL in seconds after deletion (0 if none) |
| `group` | Group name (empty if none) |
| `after-group` | After-group dependency (empty if none) |
| `concurrency-key` | Concurrency key (empty if none) |
| `concurrency-limit` | Max concurrent reservations for this key |
| `file` | WAL file sequence number (0 if no WAL) |

## Group Stats (`stats-group <name>`)

Returns group state in YAML format.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Group name |
| `pending` | Jobs in the group not yet deleted |
| `buried` | Buried jobs in the group (block completion) |
| `complete` | Whether all jobs in the group have been deleted |
| `waiting-jobs` | Number of `aft:` jobs waiting for this group |

## Prometheus Metrics

When `--metrics-port` is set, an HTTP endpoint at `/metrics` serves
Prometheus-format metrics.
